\title{Perform UMAP Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering}
\usage{
perform_umap_clustering(filtered_df, seed = 42)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_df}{A numeric data frame with features already filtered (e.g., via correlation thresholding).}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for reproducibility of UMAP and k-means. Default is 42.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{umap_result}{A data frame with UMAP1, UMAP2, and cluster labels.}
  \item{k}{The optimal number of clusters found.}
  \item{model}{The result of the k-means model.}
}
}
\description{
Applies UMAP for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering on the filtered dataset.
}
\details{
This function first standardizes the input data, then applies UMAP to reduce it to 2D.
It uses internal clustering indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters (`k`)
and performs k-means clustering. The result includes UMAP coordinates and cluster assignments.
