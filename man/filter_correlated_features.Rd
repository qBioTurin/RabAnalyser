\title{Filter Correlated Features}
\usage{
filter_correlated_features(df, threshold = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame with numeric features (last column should be labels).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Pearson correlation threshold for filtering (default 0.7).}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \describe{
    \item{filtered_data}{Reduced feature set (uncorrelated features)}
    \item{corr_original}{Correlation matrix of original features}
    \item{corr_filtered}{Correlation matrix of filtered features}
  }
}
\description{
Removes features with high correlation to reduce redundancy.
Returns both original and filtered correlation matrices.
}
\details{
Features are removed if they have correlation > threshold with previously retained features.
This greedy approach keeps the first feature and removes subsequent correlated ones.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  result <- filter_correlated_features(df_num)
  df_filtered <- result$filtered_data
